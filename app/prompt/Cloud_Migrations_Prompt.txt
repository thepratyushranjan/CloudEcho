When given a JSON context object describing a single cloud resource and asking **Cross-Cloud Migration**, produce a Markdown report with exactly four sections, following this structure:

---

## 1. Cross-Cloud Migration Overview

* **Resource ID**: `content.cloud_resource_id`
* **Name**: `content.name`
* **Current Cloud**: AWS, Region: `content.region`
* **Current Instance**: `content.meta.flavor` (X vCPUs, Y GiB RAM)
* **Current Expense This Month**: `$details.cost` (formatted to 3 decimal places)
* **Hourly Cost**: $Z.ZZZ (formatted to 3 decimal places)
* **Forecast This Month**: `$details.forecast` (formatted to 3 decimal places)
* **Last Expense**: `$last_expense.cost` (Use last_expense.cost from the JSON data, formatted to 3 decimal places)
* **Last Expense Date**: `last_expense.date` (Date Should be mm/dd/yyyy Format)

Briefly summarize the migration objective and criteria used for selecting alternatives.

---

## 2. Strategic Analysis

1. **Baseline Configuration**

   * List current specs as bullet points, sourced from `comparison.cloud_multiple_data`.

2. **Candidate Selection**

   * **Filter**: Include instances with ≥ current vCPUs and RAM.
   * **Group**: Split into AWS, GCP, and Azure lists separately.
   * **Rank**: Sort each cloud provider list by `cost_per_hour` ascending; take top 5 from each cloud provider.
   * **Display**: Show separate tables for each cloud provider only when data is available in the content.

3. **Migration & Rightsizing Candidates by Cloud Provider**

* **AWS Migration Candidates**
*(Display this table only when AWS data is available in content. If AWS data is not available, show: "AWS data is not available")*

| Instance Type | vCPUs | Memory (GiB) | Region | Location | Hourly Cost | Est. Monthly Savings | Rationale |
| ------------- | ----- | --------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| ...           | ...   | ...       | ...    | ...      | $X.XXX      | ~$XX.XXX             | ...       |

* **GCP Migration Candidates**
*(Display this table only when GCP data is available in content. If GCP data is not available, show: "GCP data is not available")*

| Instance Type | vCPUs | Memory (GiB) | Region | Location | Hourly Cost | Est. Monthly Savings | Rationale |
| ------------- | ----- | --------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| ...           | ...   | ...       | ...    | ...      | $X.XXX      | ~$XX.XXX             | ...       |

* **Azure Migration Candidates**
*(Display this table only when Azure data is available in content. If Azure data is not available, show: "Azure data is not available")*

| Instance Type | vCPUs | Memory (GiB) | Region | Location | Hourly Cost | Est. Monthly Savings | Rationale |
| ------------- | ----- | --------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| ...           | ...   | ...       | ...    | ...      | $X.XXX      | ~$XX.XXX             | ...       |

* **Monthly Savings** = (Current Hourly Cost - Candidate Hourly Cost) × 730 (all cost calculations formatted to 3 decimal places)

## 3. Actionable Recommendations

Generate 8-10 numbered, prioritized steps focused exclusively on cross-cloud migration activities. Each recommendation must be directly related to migrating resources between cloud providers. Include only migration-specific actions such as:

- Pre-migration assessment: Dependency mapping, compatibility checks, network architecture review
- Target cloud preparation: Account setup, IAM configuration, network infrastructure provisioning
- Migration tooling: Selection and configuration of migration tools, data transfer services
- Data migration strategy: Database migration planning, storage transfer methods, backup procedures
- Application migration: Containerization, code modifications, configuration management
- Network migration: DNS updates, load balancer reconfiguration, VPN/connectivity setup
- Testing and validation: Migration testing in staging, performance validation, rollback procedures
- Go-live execution: Production cutover planning, monitoring setup, post-migration validation

---

## 4. Executive Rationale

Compose a compelling paragraph that explains: current risks (security, over‑provisioning), cost‑savings opportunity, and the strategic path (immediate fixes plus a structured PoC). Highlight business impact: percentage reduction in costs, annual savings figure (formatted to 3 decimal places), and alignment with modernization goals.

## Detailed Rationale  
- Summarize the **underlying reasoning** in one paragraph.
- Reference best practices, compliance standards, or benchmarks.
- Point to any trade-offs or risks.
- All cost figures should be formatted to 3 decimal places.

---

### Tone & Formatting  
- Aim for **depth**: ~100–150 words.  
- Be **sincere**, **kind**, and **confident**.  
- Use **clear sub-headings** and **short paragraphs**.  
- Include examples or mini-scenarios when relevant.  
- Omit any extra commentary outside these four sections.
- **Important**: All monetary values must be formatted to exactly 3 decimal places (e.g., $123.102, $45.678, $0.001).
