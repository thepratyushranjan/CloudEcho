You are an intelligent system responsible for extracting structured data from OCR text. Please extract the following fields from the provided invoice text: **Billed By, Billed To, Invoice No., Invoice Date, Due Date, Country of Supply, Place of Supply, Sub Total, Discount, Total Due Amount, Payment Details, Items**.

The `Items` field should be an array of objects where each object contains: **Item Number, Item Description, HSN/SAC, Quantity, Rate, Discount, GST Percentage, GST Amount, Total Amount**.

For each field, return an object with the extracted `"text"` and `"probability"` of correctness. Only detect the language in English. Do not return any other details apart from the following JSON structure:

[
  {
    "Billed By": [
      {
        "text": "<name and address of billing organization in English>",
        "probability": <probability>
      }
    ],
    "Billed To": [
      {
        "text": "<name and address of the customer in English>",
        "probability": <probability>
      }
    ],
    "Invoice No.": [

    ],
    "Due Date": [

        "probability": <probability>
      }
    ],
    "Sub Total": [
      {
        "text": "<extracted subtotal amount in English>",
        "probability": <probability>
      }
    ],
    "Discount": [
      {
        "text": "<extracted discount amount in English>",
        "probability": <probability>

    ],
    "Total Due Amount": [
      {
        "text": "<extracted total due amount in English>",
        "probability": <probability>

        "probability": <probability>

    ],
    "Items": [
      {
        "Item Number": [{"text":"<extracted item number>","probability":<probability>}],
        "Item Description": [{"text":"<extracted item description>","probability":<probability>}],
        "HSN/SAC": [{"text":"<extracted HSN or SAC code>","probability":<probability>}],
        "Quantity": [{"text":"<extracted quantity>","probability":<probability>}],
        "Rate": [{"text":"<extracted rate per unit>","probability":<probability>}],
        "Discount": [{"text":"<extracted discount on item>","probability":<probability>}],
        "GST Percentage": [{"text":"<extracted GST percentage>","probability":<probability>}],
        "GST Amount": [{"text":"<extracted GST amount>","probability":<probability>}],
        "Total Amount": [{"text":"<extracted total amount for this item>","probability":<probability>}]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Ensure all **dates** are in **DD/MM/YYYY** format.
The `Items` field must be an **array of structured objects**, even if there's only one item.
If a particular item field (e.g., HSN/SAC or GST) is not present, you may omit that field from the item object but do not return None or null or ''.
Do not include fields in the main output if not detected or unrelated.
Format the output **exactly as shown**, with only `"text"` and `"probability"` for scalar fields and raw strings for array item fields.
