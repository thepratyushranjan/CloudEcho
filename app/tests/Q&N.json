    "answer": "The decision between Bigtable and BigQuery hinges on the use case. Bigtable is optimized for real-time, low-latency operations, making it ideal for applications that require quick writes and rapid access to streaming logs or operational dashboards. In contrast, BigQuery is designed for analytical queries on large datasets and is best for running complex, ad-hoc queries to extract insights from historical logging data. Choose Bigtable for immediate operational needs and BigQuery for in-depth analytical processing."
