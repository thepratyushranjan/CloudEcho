When given a JSON context object describing a single cloud resource and asking **Cross-Cloud Migration**, produce a Markdown report with exactly four sections, following this structure:

---

## 1. Cross-Cloud Migration Overview

* **Resource ID**: `content.cloud_resource_id`
* **Name**: `content.name`
* **Current Cloud**: AWS, Region: `content.region`
* **Current Instance**: `content.meta.flavor` (X vCPUs, Y GiB RAM)
* **Hourly Cost**: \$Z.ZZZZ
* **Estimated Monthly Cost**: \$TOTAL\_COST
*  **Latest-Expense:** /${'cost': 0.4909759282, 'date': 1747612800}

Briefly summarize the migration objective and criteria used for selecting alternatives.

---

## 2. Strategic Analysis

1. **Baseline Configuration**

   * List current specs as bullet points, sourced from `comparison.cloud_multiple_data`.

2. **Candidate Selection**

   * **Filter**: Include instances with ≥ current vCPUs and RAM.
   * **Group**: Split into AWS and Azure lists.
   * **Rank**: Sort each list by `cost_per_hour` ascending; take top 5 from each.
   * **Consolidate**: Merge both lists and pick the overall top 5 by hourly cost.

3. **Top 5 Migration & Rightsizing Candidates**

| Cloud | Instance Type | vCPUs | RAM (GiB) | Region |Location | Hourly Cost | Est. Monthly Savings | Rationale |
| ----- | ------------- | ----- | --------- | ------ |-------  | ----------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| ...   | ...           | ...   | ...       | ...    | ...     |...          | \~\$XX.XX            | ...       |

Note: Ensure each Instance Type in this table is unique.

* **Monthly Savings** = (Current Hourly Cost - Candidate Hourly Cost) × 730

## 3. Actionable Recommendations

Provide 8–10 numbered, prioritized steps. Sample items:

1. **Validate Top Candidate**: Benchmark `<Cloud> <Instance Type>` in `<Region>` to confirm performance and tooling compatibility.
2. **Engage Stakeholders**: Schedule a discussion with owner **Balaji Rao** to align on performance requirements and migration impact.
3. **Secure Current Resource**: Restrict SSH (Port 22) on `launch-wizard-10` security group to known IPs.
4. **Pricing Strategy**: Explore Reserved Instances or Savings Plans for top AWS/Azure options.
5. **Data Migration Costs**: Quantify egress fees from AWS `ap-south-1` for accurate TCO.
6. **Dependency Mapping**: Inventory all related services (DB, cache, queues) for cross-cloud provisioning.
7. **Immediate Savings**: Implement automated shutdown schedule to capture \~\$56.63/month savings.
8. **PoC & Rollout Plan**: Draft migration plan with data sync, DNS cutover, and rollback procedures.
9. **Finalize Business Case**: Present TCO, PoC results, and savings projections to leadership.

## 4. Executive Rationale

Compose a compelling paragraph that explains: current risks (security, over‑provisioning), cost‑savings opportunity, and the strategic path (immediate fixes plus a structured PoC). Highlight business impact: percentage reduction in costs, annual savings figure, and alignment with modernization goals.


## Detailed Rationale  
- Summarize the **underlying reasoning** in one paragraph.
- Reference best practices, compliance standards, or benchmarks.
- Point to any trade-offs or risks.

---

### Tone & Formatting  
- Aim for **depth**: ~100–200 words.  
- Be **sincere**, **kind**, and **confident**.  
- Use **clear sub-headings** and **short paragraphs**.  
- Include examples or mini-scenarios when relevant.  
- Omit any extra commentary outside these four sections.
