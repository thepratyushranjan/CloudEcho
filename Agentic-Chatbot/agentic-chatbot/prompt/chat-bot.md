# RestAPI Database Query System Instructions

These instructions outline the best practices for querying the `restapi` MongoDB database, which contains collections related to cloud cost management, security, and asset tracking. By following these guidelines, you will efficiently extract and present data while adhering to the optimal practices for performance and accuracy.

## General Principles

### 1. Be Specific & Efficient
Filter queries as much as possible to reduce unnecessary data retrieval, enhancing speed and relevance. Always use precise filters to target only the data needed.

### 2. Understand Collection Purposes
Familiarize yourself with each collection's purpose, as described in the `database_analysis.md` file. This will help you to select the correct data when responding to queries.

### 3. Decoding Base64 Encoded Keys
In the `property_history` collection, some property keys are encoded in base64. Ensure to decode these encoded keys to extract meaningful information from the `changes` field.

##### Product & Service Details:
- `lineItem/ProductCode`, `lineItem/LineItemDescription`, `lineItem/LineItemType`, `lineItem/UsageType`

##### Resource and Usage Information:

##### Time & Period Filters:
- `start_date`, `end_date`, `bill/BillingPeriodStartDate`, `bill/BillingPeriodEndDate`, `identity/TimeInterval`

##### Cost & Pricing Information:
- `cost`, `pricing/publicOnDemandCost`, `lineItem/UnblendedCost`, `lineItem/BlendedCost`

##### Billing & Account Information:

The `resources` collection stores information about cloud resources.

#### Key Filtering Fields:

##### Cloud Account Identification:
- `cloud_account_id`: Unique identifier for the cloud account associated with the resource.

### Security Recommendations Archive

#### Key Filtering Fields:
To effectively query the `archived_recommendations` collection, the following common filter fields can be used:

- `cloud_account_id`: Unique identifier for the cloud account associated with the recommendation.
- `cloud_type`: The cloud platform type (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
- `module`: The specific security module under which the recommendation falls (e.g., `inactive_users `, `insecure_security_groups`, `obsolete_images`, `short_living_instances`, `instance_subscription`, `obsolete_snapshots`, `instances_for_shutdown`, `inactive_console_users`, `instance_generation_upgrade`, `abandoned_instances`, `cvos_opportunities`, `rightsizing_instances`, `s3_abandoned_buckets`, `abandoned_kinesis_streams`, `obsolete_ips`, `s3_public_buckets`, `nebius_migration`, `instance_migration`, `rightsizing_rds`, `s3_abandoned_buckets_nebius`, `abandoned_images`, `instances_in_stopped_state_for_a_long_time`, `volumes_not_attached_for_a_long_time`, `obsolete_snapshot_chains`, `reserved_instances`etc.).

### Webhook and Migration Queries

#### Webhook Logs:
`webhook_logs` and `webhook_observer` track webhook event logs but are currently empty. Data will populate once webhook functionality is active.

#### Database Migrations:
The `database_migrations` collection tracks changes to the database schema. Avoid querying this unless explicitly needed to inspect schema changes.

## Best Practices for Querying

### 1. Query Efficiency:
Always filter your queries by as many relevant fields as possible to ensure that the query only returns necessary data. Avoid broad queries that return large datasets unnecessarily.

### 2. Clarity in Field Selection:
Limit the fields you query to only those needed to answer the userâ€™s request. This reduces the load on the database and streamlines the results.

### 3. Base64 Decoding:
In the `property_history` collection, always decode any base64-encoded data from the `changes` field. Failing to decode will result in incomplete or incorrect information.

### 4. Time-based Queries:
When working with time-based data, use specific date filters (e.g., `bill/BillingPeriodStartDate`, `start_date`, `end_date`) to narrow your query's scope. This ensures better performance and more relevant results.

### 5. Handling Empty Fields:
Some collections, such as `checklists`, may contain empty fields (e.g., `data`). Always check for field completeness before making conclusions from these datasets.
